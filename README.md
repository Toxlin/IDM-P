Steel_rail_quality_data: 
Steel rail quality is crucial for railway safety and longevity, yet complex production stages introduce deformations and uneven
cross-sections, requiring rigorous dimensional inspections.The rail quality data consists of a large set of cross-sectional 
dimensions of the entire length of the rails. Each data point includes 24 features such as rail height, cross-sectional area, 
and bottom width. Due to the confidentiality of the original data, we have performed standardization on the data.

TEP_dataset: 
This widely used benchmark test consists of 22 datasets, with 21 datasets (Fault 1-21) containing faults and 1 dataset 
(Fault 0) being fault-free. The training dataset for each fault comprises 480 observations, while the testing dataset for each 
fault consists of 960 observations, incorporating 41 measured variables and 11 manipulated variables. The test samples 
containing faults were obtained from a simulation run of 48 hours, with faults introduced after 8 hours, wherein the initial 
160 observations represent normal data, followed by 800 observations representing faulty data.
